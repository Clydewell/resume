                     I'm Chris. I'm an experienced and versatile town planner who specialises in building
                     GIS, data analysis and programming workflows for evidence-based strategic planning.
                     
                     I can also build, lead and mentor high performance planning teams. 
                     
                     I have managed and created planning schemes at some of the biggest councils in SEQ.
                     
                     
                     I have worked on a wide range of strategic planning policy projects. 
                     
                     My career to date has spanned the Sunshine Coast, Brisbane, Gold Coast, New South
                     Wales, New Zealand and the UK. I have been proud to call SEQ home since 2000.
